## Documentation

The help output from the Fastly CLI is consumed by the Fastly Developer Hub to produce online documentation: https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/cli

Part of the documentation is to provide additional usage examples and links to APIs used by the CLI commands (example: https://www.fastly.com/documentation/reference/clibackend/create/#examples).

These examples and API references are defined in [`pkg/app/metadata.json`](./pkg/app/metadata.json).
