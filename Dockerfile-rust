# How do we incorporate dynamic config constraints?
# e.g. `r.config.File.Language.Rust.RustupConstraint`
#
# NOTE: This isn't a problem for 'now' because:
# rustup_constraint = ">= 1.23.0"
# So by virtue of using `FROM rust:latest` we should satisfy the constraint.

# Again, how do we incorporate the dynamic config?
# We could use environment variable and in CI call the config endpoint to get
# the value to pass into Docker container using -e flag.
#
# Alternatively, within the Docker build phase we could run the CLI with a
# subcommand like `fastly version` which will trigger the dynamic configuration
# to be pulled down and then locate the file and extract files necessary.
RUN rustup toolchain install 1.49.0

# See above comments re: values from dynamic config.
RUN rustup target add wasm32-wasi --toolchain 1.49.0

# NOTE: I don't believe we need to worry about fastly-sys constraint because
# that only happens on `compute build` and is dependant on a Cargo.toml file
# which is only present after running `compute init`. I don't think the
# container image should contain that file. The container image should only
# install the CLI and configure any foundational Rust dependencies.
