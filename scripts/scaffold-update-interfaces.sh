# UPDATE INTERFACE FILE
#
# The interface file contains all the API functions we expect to use from the
# go-fastly SDK. When adding a new command, we want to update this file to
# reflect any new API functions we're intending to use.
#
# The logic in this file is more complex than the other scaffolding scripts
# because we're manipulating an existing file that isn't code-generated.
#
# I use Vim to handle the processing because it's easier for me (@integralist)
# to write the otherwise complex logic, compared to trying to use bash or some
# other tool such as Awk.
#
# STEPS:
# - We locate the Interface type.
# - Copy the last set of interface methods.
# - Capture line number for start of copied methods (to use in substitution).
# - Rename the API (three separate places per line).
#
# NOTE:
# Any backslash in the substitution commands (e.g. \v) need to be double escaped.
#   - Once because the backslash is inside the :exe command's expected string.
#   - And then again because of the parent HEREDOC container.
#
# CAVEATS:
# This isn't a perfect process. Its successfulness is based on whether the last
# set of commands align with our expectations. It will still produce ~95%
# expected output, but if there's an extra API function (e.g. BatchModify) then
# that line won't have the relevant API name replaced as we only look for the
# common CRUD methods (Create, Delete, Get, List, Update).

# UPDATE RUN FILE
#
# The run file contains all the CLI commands we expect to expose to users.
# We want to update this file to reflect any new commands we've added.
#
# STEPS:
# - We locate an existing command we want to copy.
# - Copy the command instantiations.
# - Rename the package name.
# - Yank the new commands to the vim register.
# - Insert the new commands into the list that will be parsed by cmd.Select()
#
# The command we copy depends on whether we're creating a top-level command or
# a category command. If the former we copy the 'backend' command set, if the
# latter we'll copy the 'vcl' command set as it defines the category as a root
# command and passes that to the nested root command.
#
# NOTE:
# Any backslash in the substitution commands need to be escaped because of the
# parent HEREDOC container.
#
# Although it looks like the list of commands in run.go is sorted, they are
# actually manually ordered alphabetically and that's because each commands
# 'root' command needs to be at the top, and sorting the list would cause that
# to break. So it's important you don't attempt to sort the list. The purpose of
# this automation script is to save some manual key strokes. You'll have to
# manually sort the newly created lines yourself.
